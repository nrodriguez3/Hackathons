The obvious reason being that, if we delete the data point containing missing data (__List wise deletion__), we will end up with a small number of samples to train our learning model and thus accuracy would be of concern. And, if we summarise the variables with it's observed values (__Available Case Analysis__), we consider different samples while summarising each variable."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9a49dd6f14ccaba6db51c3a8fb6e55ac599be5dd"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Why not impute with a common value?

In other words, we add some bias to our estimation. For example, a person who earns just enough to meet his daily needs might not be comfortable in mentioning his salary, and thus the value for the variable `salary` would be missing for such a person.
